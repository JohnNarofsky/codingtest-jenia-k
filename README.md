*** Important: Do NOT share any of the contents of this repository with anyone ***

Included in this repository are 2 folders, one for the react version of the exercise and one for the vue version of the exercise. Clone this repository into a working folder. Instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project are in the sub-project README.md. Both require Node version 20 or higher. Once the web app is running, navigate to the localhost page (http://localhost:5173), to see the project and instructions. Here are some additional instructions:

- Read over the Overview and Current Functionality sections.
- Implement the section "Task Set - Basic Functionality"
- Implement the section "Task Set - Basic Improvements"
- Implement the section "Task Set - UX/UI Redesign"
- If you have time, try to implement the "Bonus Task Set - Second Elevator" section
- Limit yourself to only 4 hours of working time for this assignment. Those hours do not need to be continuous (ie, you can take breaks, it can span multiple days, etc.).
- We don't expect you to finish the first 3 items in the allotted time, so don't worry if you are unable to. This is not a test. The point of this is to get a sample of your work.
- Treat this as if it were a set of stories for a project at work. Use all of your coding best practices while implementing the stories.
- When you are finished, push the files back to this repository. You may use many commits and pushes if you like. We will only look at the code once you are finished.
- Email me back when you are completely done. Include in the email any information you think we should know while reviewing your work.

If you have any questions, please reply to the email and I can help. The deadline for returning this is Tuesday, November 4th, 11:59PM.

Good luck!
